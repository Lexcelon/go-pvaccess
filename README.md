go-pvaccess provides a native Golang client and server for the [pvAccess protocol](https://epics-controls.org/resources-and-support/documents/pvaccess/) used by the [EPICS](https://epics-controls.org/) distributed control system.

It is currently pre-alpha and does not have a stable API. A limited subset of channel operations is supported, in server mode only.
